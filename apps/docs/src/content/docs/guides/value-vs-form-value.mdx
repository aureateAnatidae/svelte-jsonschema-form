Once you create a form, you access its state through the `value` and `formValue` properties.
Let's take a look at their uses:

`value: T | undefined`

- Intended for use by the user
- Maintains the consistency of the form state
  - Returns a snapshot of the form state
  - The update takes into account the default values from the JSON Schema

`formValue: SchemaValue | undefined`

- Intended for use by the library
- Direct access to the form state
