The `createForm3` function returns this type `FormState<T, E> & FormInternals`.

Let's look at the differences between these types using their `value (state)` and
`formValue (internals)` properties as an example:

`value: T | undefined`

- Intended for use by the user
- Maintains the consistency of the form state
  - Returns a snapshot of the form state
  - The update takes into account the default values from the JSON Schema

`formValue: SchemaValue | undefined`

- Intended for use by the library
- Direct access to the form state
