By default, form data will only be validated by HTML5 validation and the provided validator when submitted.

:::tip

To disable HTML5 validation pass `novalidate` attribute to the form element.

## Live validation (not recommended)

By utilizing Svelte 5 reactivity, we can easily implement live validation.

<Code code={liveValidationCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <LiveValidation />
</Card>

While it is possible, this approach has low efficiency, because usually
revalidation of the whole form when changing one field does not make sense.

## Fields validation

Instead of full form revalidation, we propose to perform revalidation of only the changing field and
full validation of the form when submitting.

:::note

By default, fields validation is performed with a debounce of {DEFAULT_FIELDS_VALIDATION_DEBOUNCE_MS}ms.

This can be changed by passing the `fieldsValidationDebounceMs` option.

:::

<Code code={fieldsValidationCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <FieldsValidation />
</Card>

The form in this example will only revalidate input fields on the `input` and `change` events after the first submission of the form.

<LinkCard title="Fields validation mode API reference" href="../../api-reference/fields-validation-mode/" />

## Async validation

The form supports asynchronous validation, please see your validator page for more information.

:::note

By default, a new form validation process can only be started after the previous one is completed;
a new input validation process aborts the previous one.

You can change this behavior by passing the `validationCombinator` and `fieldsValidationCombinator` options.

:::

To correctly display potential validation process errors you should use the `handleValidationProcessError` option.

:::note

By default, messages about aborting input validation are not displayed

:::

<Code code={asyncValidationCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <AsyncValidation />
</Card>

## Focus on first error

You can achieve focus on the first error by using the `focusOnFirstError` function.

<Code code={focusOnFirstErrorCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <FocusOnFirsError />
</Card>

1. `focusOnFirstError` will try to find a focusable element and focus it.
2. If it's not found, it will try to find an errors list and scroll it into view.
3. If it's not found, it will return `false`, so you can extend the behavior.

## Errors list

Creating a list of errors is pretty simple.

<Code code={errorsListCode} lang="svelte" />

<Card>
  <ErrorsList />
</Card>
