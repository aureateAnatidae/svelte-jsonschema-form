Use a factory to create a form to access its state.

:::tip

Use getters to pass reactive parameters to the `createForm` (`createMyForm`) function.

:::

:::note

The `form.value` property is an accessor that maintains form state consistency

- A **snapshot** of the form state is returned on access
- Default values from JSON Schema are taken into account during assignment

You can gain direct access to the internal state by hacking types:

```typescript
(form.context as FormInternalContext<typeof validator>).value
```

:::

<Code code={formStateCode} lang="svelte" />

<FormCard>
  <FormStateForm client:only="svelte" />
</FormCard>
