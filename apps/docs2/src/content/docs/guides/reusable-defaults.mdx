import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import customFormCode from '@/components/my-form.ts?raw';
import customFormComponentCode from '@/components/my-form.svelte?raw';


Even with a simple setup, resulting code is very verbose.
Therefore, after choosing a resolver, theme, validator and translation, it is convenient to create a wrapper around the `createForm`.

<Code code={customFormCode} lang="typescript" title="my-form.ts" />

:::note

Note that you can simplify the above code if certain restrictions are met:

- If you are sure that you will always call the `createForm` function with passing the object literal, you can use the following code instead of `Proxy`:

`Object.setPrototypeOf(options, defaults)`

- If you are sure you will not use getters as options, then use `Object.assign` instead of `Proxy`:

`Object.assign(defaults, options)`

## Component

You also can create your own form component.

<Code code={customFormComponentCode} lang="svelte" title="custom-form.svelte" />
